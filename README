Colony

C++/SFML project

Combining a lifelong love of city-builder games and little free time, I'm kludging together a game. It'll probably never be big; I work for a major game publisher so there are probably ramifications that would bite me in the ass anyhow. But being a gamer stuck in IT, I figure this is probably going to be the only outlet I ever get. :)

My goal is to implement all aspects of a full game, even if it's a crappy one with nothing but placeholder graphics and enough imbalance to cause /r/starcraft to implode.
